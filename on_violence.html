        <p><b>On Violence -- Arthur Jafa and J G Ballard </b></p>

        <p>Both Arthur Jafa and J. G. Ballard explore your inattentiveness, although the fields on which they play
            greatly
            differ. Between the ex-imperial stylings of Ballard’s writing in the 60s and 70s to the contemporary video
            compositions of Jafa there’s an almost unbridgeable leap across time, medium, and (arguably) relevance. But
            the
            two also share a willingness to delve into a violence-entrenched masculinity, forming a pact with the viewer
            to
            leave no stone unturned in return for a poetic harmony that can be found in their work.</p>
        <p>Last year, the artist and filmmaker Arthur Jafa made headlines when the then Supreme creative director,
            Tremaine
            Emory, resigned over the brands refusal to include the famous “Whipped Peter” photograph as part of a
            collaboration with Jafa. Jafa’s motive for using this image, equally famous and upsetting, of course remains
            up
            for interpretation. But it might have something to do with the juxtaposition of Supreme, a culture-absorbent
            ex-skating brand now mostly associated with rich white kids, with a picture of a heavily scarred slave used
            in
            the abolitionist movement. Tremaine Emory speaks about it articulately in an interview Touré – go watch that
            if
            you haven’t. </p>
        <p>But its Jafa’s video work that reveals most about his positioning of violence. I’m thinking here of the
            brilliant
            APEX (2013), or its strung-out counterpart SLOPEX (2023), where juxtaposing imagery flashes in front of you
            like
            a game of psychosocial battleship, exposing you to a horrifying image just long enough to elicit a response
            before moving onto an image with a completely different set of cultural or visual components. </p>
        <p>In a way, Jafa is playing with post-diction here, a principle of perception that what we see in the moment is
            greatly influenced by what we saw before or after it. Rather than perceiving things completely in the
            present,
            how any sense information is evaluated is influenced both by what comes before us and what’s coming next.
            Jafa
            uses the flexible temporality of perception to create degrees of discordance or harmony between the mental
            reverb of one image with the next already in front of you. Exactly analogous to music composition, Jafa
            makes
            violence one note among many in a library of impulses and emotions we usually experience in a more drawn
            out,
            seeking sort of way. </p>
        <p>Ballard’s exploration of violence, such as in the novel Crash (1973), can be thought of in a parallel way.
            Such a
            controversial and highly publicized work as Crash, a book about the sexuality entrenched in cars, motorways,
            airports, and motor-accidents, has evoked many misinterpretations. I find Martin Amis’s interpretation that
            the
            book is about the attempt of a character trying to overcome the ‘shock’ of being in a crash to be completely
            wrong, for example. It is indeed the case that the sexual liberation (or aberration) of the protagonist
            follows
            a car crash, resulting in the melding of their body and the car into a single erogenous zone. But this
            fusing
            between desire and death occurs to almost every character present in the book who experiences a crash. </p>
        <p>Despite Ballard claiming so in the introduction, Crash is not a warning about cars and their dangers, or an
            exploration of psychological aberration caused by trauma, but an insight into the incantation made when
            mixing
            violence and visual consumption. In Ballard’s world, the act of the crash is transformed into a ritual
            practice
            that exerts a previously hidden force on those who survive it. This force is embodied in the character
            Vaughn,
            the de facto leader of the sex/death cult that forms around the car crash. Vaughn’s and his followers’
            obsession
            with celebrities is evidence towards visual imagery being at the centre of this blood-pact. As agents of a
            violent underworld that finally sees the car for what it is, a sexual prosthesis for the death-drive
            instinct,
            their primary goal is to envelop their diametric opposite, the picture-perfect fantasy of the movie-star
            where
            even sexuality is sterilised by the image. Again, Ballard is using violence as a way to comment on our
            relationship to imagery (albeit from a more traditional angle) in which images form the allure of a consumer
            culture that has its logical end in the bizarre and graphic world of Crash.</p>
        <p> Both Jafa’s APEX and Ballard’s Crash have an initial quality of can’t look away -ness to them. But both
            utilise
            this quality, this pulpiness, to compose something much more contemplative. They operate against the grain
            of a
            culture increasingly sanitised by AI content moderation and short-format media. And even if this, on its
            own,
            doesn’t guarantee any superior depth or value, approaching their work takes on more weight in this new and
            ultra-clean context where the conscious world is learnt and reproduced by mass data modelling. </p>
